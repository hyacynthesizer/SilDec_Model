# SilDec_Model
 Tracking positions of planets as time progresses
 ## Goals for this project:
 - Implement core 3D ellipse functions for planetary orbits (copy from Mathematica)
 - (Related, be able to tweak the orbital parameters without entirely dying)
 - Zoom-able scale for viewing relevant sections of solar system
 - Reference compass and mini-view to not get lost
 - Orbits of moons around their host planets, reference frames and stuff
 - To-scale sizes for planet, star, moon sizes
 - Scaling orbital periods based on standard time-step
 - Conversion to solar arc calendar, and any other local calendars
 - Noting the seasons and other timekeeping statistics for each planet
 - Various sliders and steps to adjust the time from the initial reference point
 - Calculating distances between points, and the time it would take the ship to travel them
 - Hopefully, some kind of orbital interception plotting-thing, to know when to aim for, given ship speed
 - Logging and displaying history of ship's travel paths
 - Making it all look nice, and sort of like what the ship's maps would look like
